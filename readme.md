# MiniGit

This project involved creating a version control system modeled after Git. This includes creating the commands `init`, `add`, `commit`, `rm`, `log`, `globalLog`, `find`, `checkout`, `branch`, `rmBranch`, `reset`, and `status`. This project involved learning about Git and its inner workings, Persistence in Java, Hashmaps, serialization, and more.

Project Outline and Instructions are from UC San Diego's Data Structures and Algorithms (DSC30) Bonus Project.  DSC30 is a course included in the lower division requirements for UC San Diego's Data Science Major (DS25). The detail and full breakdown of the project can be seen here: [https://dsc30-bonus-project.github.io/](url). Utility classes and skeleton classes were provided in order to aid in the development of the version control system. All other logic was done by me.
